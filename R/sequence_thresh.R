#' Threshold segment correlations
#' @description Thresholds correlation between all segments length n of a vector
#' @param sequ Output of [twopointzerothree::sequence_cor()]
#' @param threshold Minimum correlation to accept. Defaults to 1, possible range -1 to 1 (but values much below 1 make no sense)
#' @param tolerance Small positive number to allow for numerical imprecision
#' @details Tests if correlations are >= than a given threshold (with tolerance for imprecision in correlations). Default threshold is 1 (perfect correlation). Might be useful to reduce this slightly, or equivalently increase tolerance to allow for cases where imprecision is high.
